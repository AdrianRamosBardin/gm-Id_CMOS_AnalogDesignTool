# gm-Id_CMOS_AnalogDesignTool
This a Python-based tool that takes simulation data exported from your favorite analog SPICE simulator (Spectre in my case) and lets access it and visualize it in the spot. It can really plot anything you want, but the intended use case is to make quick and precise CMOS design in sub-micron technologies using the gm/Id design approach.
